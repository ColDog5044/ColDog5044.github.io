# Hey, I'm Collin! 👋

I'm a **Systems Support Analyst** who's passionate about homelabs and infrastructure. I started this blog to share what I'm learning as I build and experiment with enterprise technologies - from Active Directory and domain controllers to security hardening and automation.

My goal is to create the guides and documentation I wish existed when I was learning these topics - detailed, practical, and explained in a way that makes sense.

## My Background

I've been working in IT for about three years now, and try to continue learning something new every day.

### Certifications

- CompTIA Security+
- CompTIA Network+
- CompTIA A+
- CompTIA ITF+
- Cisco Certified Support Technician (CCST)
- TestOut Cyber Defense Pro
- TestOut Ethical Hacker Pro
- TestOut Linux Pro

## Why Document?

I believe the best way to truly learn something is to:
1. Build it yourself
2. Break it (accidentally or on purpose)
3. Fix it
4. Write about it

This collection of guides and documentation covers my journey through enterprise technologies, homelab experiments, and everything I'm learning along the way.
