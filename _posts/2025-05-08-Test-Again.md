## This is a test post

For testing purposes, I wanted to create a post and see what would happen.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Username> Get-Help Write-Output

NAME
    Write-Output

SYNTAX
    Write-Output [-InputObject] <psobject> [-NoEnumerate] [<CommonParameters>]


ALIASES
    write
    echo


REMARKS
    Get-Help cannot find the Help files for this cmdlet on this computer. It is displaying only partial help.
        -- To download and install Help files for the module that includes this cmdlet, use Update-Help.
        -- To view the Help topic for this cmdlet online, type: "Get-Help Write-Output -Online" or
           go to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=2097117.

PS C:\Users\Username> Write-Output "This is a test."
This is a test.
```

This can also be a template for the future.
